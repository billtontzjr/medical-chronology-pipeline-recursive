# OCR Quality Validator

Check extracted text files for OCR errors that might impact accuracy.

**Common OCR Issues:**
- Garbled medical terms
- Date formatting errors
- Missing sections
- Medication name errors
- Transposed numbers

For each file, report:
- Filename
- Overall quality (good/moderate/poor)
- Specific issues found
- Whether it's processable

This helps flag documents that need manual review.
